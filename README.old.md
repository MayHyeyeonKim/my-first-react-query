This repository will focus primarily on React Query among various React state management libraries. Below is a description of the most commonly used libraries. their key features, and their pros and cons.

# React State Management Libraries

## 1. React Context API

**Features**:
- Built-in state management tool in React.
- Suitable for managing global state in small applications.

**Pros**:
- Simple to use and integrates well with React.
- No need for external libraries.

**Cons**:
- Can lead to performance issues and code complexity in larger applications.

## 2. Redux

**Features**:
- Centralizes global state management.
- Ideal for large-scale applications with complex state management needs.

**Pros**:
- Improves predictability of state changes.
- Strong integration with debugging tools.

**Cons**:
- Initial setup can be complex.
- Requires a significant amount of boilerplate code.

## 3. MobX

**Features**:
- Supports reactive programming with observable state objects.
- Good for applications with frequently changing or asynchronous state.

**Pros**:
- Simplifies state management with a clean, reactive approach.
- Automatically handles state updates.

**Cons**:
- Less explicit state management can make it harder to track state changes.

## 4. Recoil

**Features**:
- Developed by Facebook, integrates seamlessly with React.
- Specializes in managing hierarchical states.

**Pros**:
- Simple, intuitive API.
- Easy asynchronous state management.

**Cons**:
- Newer library with a smaller ecosystem compared to others.

## 5. Zustand

**Features**:
- Lightweight state management library.
- Uses a minimalistic Flux architecture.

**Pros**:
- Very easy to use and lightweight.
- Ideal for small projects.

**Cons**:
- May not be suitable for larger applications with complex state management needs.

## 6. Jotai

**Features**:
- Uses atoms to manage state in a modular way.
- Designed for small, independent state management tasks.

**Pros**:
- Lightweight and easy to split state management into smaller parts.
- Minimalistic and simple to use.

**Cons**:
- May become complex to manage in larger applications.

## 7. XState

**Features**:
- Utilizes state machines and statecharts to define and manage state transitions.
- Suitable for applications that require well-defined state transitions.

**Pros**:
- Increases predictability and readability of state management.
- Excellent for complex state transition management.

**Cons**:
- Learning curve involved with understanding state machines.
- May be overkill for simple applications.


## 8. React Query

**Features**:
- A library focused on managing server state, including data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updating.
- Designed to simplify the management of remote data in React applications.

**Pros**:
- Simplifies and automates data fetching logic.
- Provides built-in caching and background synchronization.
- Reduces boilerplate for server data management.
- Automatically handles request status like loading, error, and success states.

**Cons**:
- Primarily focuses on server state, not suitable for managing complex client-side state.
- Requires understanding of caching and server state management concepts.

### Local State and Global State Management with React Query

React Query is specifically designed for managing **server state**. However, **local state** and **global state** management should still be handled separately with appropriate tools:

1. **Local State (Local Component State)**:
   - Managed using React's built-in hooks such as `useState` and `useReducer`.
   - Best for state that is local to a single component, like form inputs or toggles.

2. **Global State (Application-wide State)**:
   - Managed using state management libraries like **React Context API**, **Redux**, **Recoil**, **Zustand**, etc.
   - Used for state that needs to be shared across multiple components, like user authentication status, themes, or global application settings.

### Combining React Query with Other State Management Tools

React Query can be combined with other state management tools to provide a complete state management solution:

- **React Query + React Context API**:
  - Use React Query for managing server state (e.g., data fetching and caching).
  - Use Context API for lightweight global state management (e.g., theme toggling, simple app-wide settings).

- **React Query + Redux**:
  - Use Redux to manage global client-side state that requires more complex logic or middleware (e.g., user authentication, complex UI state).
  - Use React Query for server state management to handle data fetching and synchronization with remote APIs.

- **React Query + Recoil**:
  - Use Recoil for managing complex global state where components need to share state efficiently.
  - React Query is used for managing and synchronizing server state, such as fetching data from APIs and caching.

- **React Query + Zustand**:
  - Zustand is ideal for managing local or lightweight global state with minimal boilerplate.
  - Combine Zustand with React Query for applications that need both simple state management and advanced server state handling.

React Query effectively handles all things related to **server state**, while traditional state management libraries (Redux, Recoil, Zustand, etc.) are best suited for **client-side state** (both local and global). Choosing the right combination depends on the specific requirements of your application.
